    "At the base of everything are the two modules `core` and `torch_core` (we're not including the `fastai.` prefix when naming modules in these docs). They define the basic functions we use in the library; `core` only relies on general modules, whereas `torch_core` requires pytorch. Most type-hinting shortcuts are defined there too (at least the one that don't depend on fastai classes defined later). Nearly all modules below import `torch_core`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there are three modules directly on top of `torch_core`: \n",
    "- `data`, which contains the class that will take a `Dataset` or pytorch `DataLoader` to wrap it in a `DeviceDataLoader` (a class that sits on top of a `DataLoader` and is in charge of putting the data on the right device as well as applying transforms such as normalization) and regroup then in a `DataBunch`.\n",
    "- `layers`, which contains basic functions to define custom layers or groups of layers\n",
    "- `metrics`, which contains all the metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "From `layers`, we have all the modules in the models folder that are defined. Then from `data` we can split on one of the four main *applications*, which each has their own module: `vision`, `text` `colab`, or `tabular`. Each of those submodules is built in the same way with:\n",
    "- a submodule named `transform` that handles the transformations of our data (data augmentation for computer vision, numericalizing and tokenizing for text and preprocessing for tabular)\n",
    "- a submodule named `data` that contains the class that will create datasets and the helper functions to create `DataBunch` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes care of building your model and handling the data. We regroup those in a `Learner` object to take care of training. More specifically:\n",
    "- `callback` defines the basis of callbacks and the `CallbackHandler`. Those are functions that will be called every step of the way of the training loop and can allow us to customize what is happening there;\n",
    "- `basic_train` defines `Learner` and `Recorder` (which is a callback that records stats and takes care of updating the progress bars) and have the training loop;\n",
    "- `callbacks` is a submodule defining various callbacks;\n",
    "- `learn` defines helper functions to invoke the callbacks more easily.\n",
