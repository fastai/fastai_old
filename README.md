## Current Status

This is a ground-up rewrite of fastai. Everything should work, although docs are still in progress. If you're interested in contributing, join the discussion at: http://forums.fast.ai/c/fastai-dev.

## Install

To use the notebooks or the beta version of the fastai modules you will need:
- to use python 3.7 or python 3.6 with [dataclasses](https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses): `pip install dataclasses`
- to use the `pytorch-nightly` conda package, or the master branch of [pytorch master](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source)
- to install [fastprogress](https://github.com/fastai/fastprogress): `pip install fastprogress`



### PyPI Install

First install the nightly `pytorch` build, e.g. for CUDA 9.2:

    pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu92/torch_nightly.html

If you have a different CUDA version find the right build [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Choose Preview/Linux/Pip/python3.6 and Your CUDA version and it will give you the correct install instruction.

Now you can install `fastai`. Note, that this is a beta test version at the moment, please [report any issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_pytorch/issues/):

     pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url  https://pypi.org/simple/ fastai==1.0.0b3


### Conda Install

First install the nightly `pytorch` build:

    conda install -c pytorch pytorch-nightly

then:

    conda install -c fastai/label/test torchvision=0.2.1=pyhe7f20fa_0

We had to build a special version of torchvision which depends on `pytorch-nightly`.

Now you can install `fastai`. Note, that this is a beta test version at the moment, please [report any issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_pytorch/issues/).

Currently only `linux-64`/`python3.6` conda build is available:

    conda install -c fastai/label/test fastai

For other setups/platforms use `pip install` at the moment (see above).



### Developer Install

    conda install pytorch-nightly -c pytorch
    pip install torchvision
    git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai_pytorch
    cd fastai_pytorch
    pip install -e .
